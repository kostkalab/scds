**s**ingle **c**ell **d**oublet **s**coring: In-silico doublet annotation for single cell RNA sequencing data

```scds``` is an ```R``` package for computational doublet annotation of single cell RNA sequencing data. It interfaces with the S4 ```SingleCellExperiment``` class [(see here)](https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.SingleCellExperiment), so it should easily integrate into many ```R```/Bioconductor scRNA-seq analysis workflows.

#### Installation

You can install `scds` using [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) (Release 3.9) as follows:

```
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("scds", version = "3.9")
```

#### Quick Start

In the following ```sce``` is a ```SingleCellExperiment``` holding at least raw counts in an assay called ```counts```.

```
#- Annotate doublet using co-expression based doublet scoring:
sce = cxds(sce)

#- Annotate doublet using binary classification based doublet scoring:
sce = bcds(sce)

#- Combine both annotations into a hybrid annotation
sce = cxds_bcds_hybrid(sce)

#- Doublet scores are now available via colData:
CD  = colData(sce)
head(cbind(CD$cxds_score,CD$bcds_score, CD$hybrid_score))
rm(CD)

```
